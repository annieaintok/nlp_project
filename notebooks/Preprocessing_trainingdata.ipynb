investors. however, trading in ﬁnancial assets often entails moral hazard due to investors’ incentives to default on their risky positions. the moral hazard can be alleviated by collat- eralized trades whereby risky positions are backed by ﬁ- nancial capital that can be seized in the event of default. the latter arrangement restores the functionality of ﬁnan- cial markets at the cost of restricting risk sharing among investors. in this paper, we develop a parsimonious model that sheds new light on the economic effects of such re- strictions. in particular, we show how collateralization in- ﬂates asset prices, generates repeated booms and busts in the stock market, and leads to spikes, crashes, and cluster- ing of stock return volatilities, persistent periods of loose and binding constraints, and cycles of high and low lever- age. our analysis is facilitated by closed-form solutions and the stationarity of equilibrium processes.

exchange economy with one consumption good produced by a tree with i.i.d. shocks, similar to lucas  . the economy is populated by two representative investors with heterogeneous constant relative risk aversion  p over consumption and heterogeneous beliefs about the output growth rate. each investor receives a fraction of the tree’s output as labor income and invests total wealth in ﬁnancial assets such as bonds and stocks. the investors have limited liability and can re-enter the ﬁnancial market following defaults on risky positions in ﬁnancial assets. in the event of default, the ﬁnancial assets can be seized by counterparties, but labor income cannot be expropriated. the arising moral hazard problem is resolved by requiring risky positions to be backed by collateral in such a way that each investor’s total ﬁnancial wealth stays positive at all times, and hence investors can always pay back to counterparties. we also allow the aggregate consumption to experience rare large negative shocks. these shocks help us explore how mere anxiety about the possibility of a production crisis affects the economy by tightening collateral constraints. our closed-form solutions allow us to prove some of the results for general model parameters rather than for particular calibrations. first, we show that collateral constraints increase the prices of all tradable assets with positive cash ﬂows rel- ative to a frictionless economy. moreover, these increases in prices are more signiﬁcant when investors are closer to their default boundaries. in particular, the stock price- dividend  ratio spikes upwards in response to small economic shocks near the default boundaries of investors, giving rise to repeated periods of high and low stock prices. the intuition for the latter results is as follows. in a frictionless economy, the investors’ consumption shares gradually approach zero or one, and hence the economic impact of one of the investors vanishes in the long run (e.g., blume and easley, 20 06; yan, 20 08; chabakauri, 2015 ). the collateral requirements restrict ﬁnancial losses and protect investors from losing their consumption shares. as a result, the consumption shares are bounded away from zero and one. moreover, the constraints never bind simultaneously for both investors, and at each moment one of the investors is unconstrained. the un- constrained investor’s marginal utility of consumption is proportional to the prices of arrow-debreu securities. this marginal utility is expected to be higher in the economy with constraints because the unconstrained investor’s consumption is expected to be lower than in the unconstrained economy due to the upper bound on the consumption share, discussed above. consequently, the prices of arrow-debreu securities, and hence the prices of all assets with positive cash ﬂows, are higher in the constrained economy. the dynamics of the p/d ratio determines the effect of constraints on volatilities. we show that collateral con- straints dampen volatilities in bad times, when the aggre- gate consumption is low, and amplify them in good times, when the aggregate consumption is high. the latter effect makes collateral constraints a useful tool for curbing ex- cessive volatility in bad times. the explanation is that the p/d ratio spikes up both in good and bad times because in good  times the pessimistic  investors in our economy lose wealth and may bind on their con- straints. as a result, the p/d ratio is procyclical in good times and is countercyclical in bad times. consequently, the p/d ratio and the dividend move in the same direc- tion in good times and in opposite directions in bad times. because the stock price is the product of the p/d ratio and the dividend, the stock return volatility increases in good times and decreases in bad times. the volatility ex- periences spikes and crashes due to the sensitivity of p/d ratios to small shocks when investors are close to hitting their constraints. moreover, the periods of high and low volatility are persistent because of the persistence of pe- riods when constraints are likely to bind, as discussed be- low, which gives rise to the clustering of volatilities. we also derive the distributions of investors’ consump- tion shares in analytic form and show that they are sta- tionary and nondegenerate (i.e., their support is a closed interval rather than a single point). the analysis of these distributions yields three economic insights. first, there is a nontrivial time variation of asset prices in the long run. second, periods of binding collateral constraints are persis- tent. that is, the economy stays close to default boundaries for some time because hitting a constraint makes likely hitting it again in the near future due to the slow accu- mulation of wealth over time. third, we show that all in- vestors, including those with incorrect beliefs, survive in the long run and can have a large economic impact in equilibrium because the constraints prevent investors from losing their consumption shares, similar to the related lit- erature . we note that the nondegeneracy of consumption share distributions and the persistence of the periods of binding constraints are more diﬃcult to demonstrate than survival, and, to the best of our knowledge, these results are new to the litera- ture. next, we show that the mere possibility of a large (al- beit unpredictable) drop in the aggregate output next pe- riod decreases interest rates and increases sharpe ratios in the current period when the irrational optimist is close to hitting the collateral constraint. the latter effect only occurs when production crises and collateral constraints are jointly present in the economy. hence, the collateral constraints amplify the spillover of the production crisis to the ﬁnancial market. the ampliﬁcation effect arises be- cause investors “ﬂy to quality” by buying riskless bonds when there is a possibility of hitting the collateral con- straint next period. we note that lower interest rates and higher sharpe ratios can be generated by alternative mech- anisms and constraints, discussed in the literature review below. however, the ampliﬁcation mechanism, to the best of our knowledge, has not been studied before. we also show that investor heterogeneity and the stationarity of equilibrium give rise to cycles of high and low leverage. in particular, the leverage is high when investors are far away from their default boundaries and drops to zero when in- vestors hit their constraints. finally, we measure the collateral liquidity premium of the stock versus labor income. this premium arises be- cause dividends and labor incomes are collinear but in- 756 g. chabakauri and b.y. han / journal of financial economics 138  754–776 comes are nonpledgeable. first, we derive shadow prices of claims to labor incomes such that exchanging marginal units of these claims for the consumption good at shadow prices does not affect investors’ welfare. then, we con- struct portfolios of stocks that replicate labor incomes. we deﬁne the collateral liquidity premium as the percentage difference in the value of the replicating portfolio and the shadow price. the premium from the view of a particu- lar investor widens close to that investor’s default bound- ary and ranges from 0% to 40% in our calibration, which demonstrates the economic signiﬁcance of collateraliza- tion. moreover, the nontradability of labor income does not contribute to this premium because, in economies with pledgeable labor income, investors circumvent nontradabil- ity by taking short positions in the stock. the paper develops a new methodology for studying the effects of collateralization. this methodology allows us to obtain closed-form equilibrium processes and to prove their properties, which previously could only be studied numerically. for example, we prove that our constraints in- crease p/d ratios and generate spikes in asset prices and lead to nondegeneracy and stationarity of consumption share distributions. the paper also introduces a tractable discrete-time setting that makes exposition less technical and permits taking continuous-time limits. the tractability and stationarity make our model a convenient benchmark for asset pricing research that can be extended in various directions. we contribute to the literature by uncovering several new economic effects of collateral constraints. in particu- lar, we show that these constraints give rise to u-shaped p/d ratios that spike when constraints are likely to bind, cause sharp increases and crashes of stock return volatil- ity, magnify volatility in good states and dampen it in bad states, and amplify the effects of crises on interest rates and sharpe ratios. our paper is the ﬁrst to derive the sta- tionary distribution of an investor’s consumption share in an economy with collateral constraints in closed form and to use it to demonstrate the persistence of periods of bind- ing constraints and nondegeneracy of the long-run equilib- rium. the nondegeneracy of equilibrium implies time vari- ation of asset prices and cycles of high and low leverage in the long run. the paper also sheds new light on the ef- fects of constraints on interest rates, sharpe ratios, and col- lateral premiums that have been reviewed in the related literature. in particular, similar to this literature, the con- straints decrease interest rates, increase sharpe ratios, and give rise to collateral premiums for stocks. in contrast to the previous studies, the effects of constraints on interest rates and sharpe ratios occur only during periods of anx- ious economy, when the mere possibility of a production crisis tightens the constraints. we also develop a new ap- proach to capturing collateral premiums and evaluate their economic signiﬁcance. closest to us are papers that study economies in which investors have limited liability and face solvency con- straints. deaton  considers a partial equilibrium model in which investors trade in a riskless asset with an exogenous interest rate and face a nonnegativity constraint on their ﬁnancial wealth. detemple and serrat  also study an economy with a nonnegative wealth in which in- vestors have heterogeneous beliefs and identical risk aver- sions. they show that this constraint introduces a singu- larity component into interest rates when the constraint binds, while stock risk premiums have the same structure as in unconstrained economies. in contrast to our work, they do not compute p/d ratios, volatilities, and consump- tion share distributions and do not study the effects of rare production crises and heterogeneity in p . chien and lustig  study a similar constraint in an economy with a continuum of ex-ante identical in- vestors that receive nonpledgeable labor incomes affected by idiosyncratic shocks. they develop similar methods us- ing multipliers in a discrete-time setting, but they do not have closed-form solutions and do not consider differences in beliefs about fundamentals. lustig and van nieuwer- burgh  study the role of housing collateral when la- bor income is nonpledgeable. the main difference of our paper from the latter two papers is that our investors are ex-ante heterogeneous and are not affected by idiosyn- cratic shocks to labor income. the economic effects of het- erogeneity in p and beliefs are different from the effects of ex-post heterogeneity in realized idiosyn- cratic income shocks in the above literature. for example, krueger and lustig  show the irrelevance of market incompleteness induced by these income shocks for the risk premiums. cao  proves the survival of investors with in- correct beliefs in the long run in economies with general collateral constraints and stationary endowment processes bounded away from zero and shows similar results nu- merically in an example with nonstationary endowments. blume et al.  explore potential beneﬁts from im- posing trading restrictions, such as natural borrowing constraints, in economies with bounded endowments and investors with heterogeneous beliefs. in contrast to these works, our results do not rely on bounded endowments. moreover, we derive consumption share distributions in closed form and establish their bimodality, station- arity, and nondegeneracy (i.e., their support is a closed interval rather than a single point). kubler and schmed- ders  prove the existence of stationary equilibria in dynamic economies with general collateral constraints. rampini and viswanathan  study household in- surance in an economy with collateral constraints with limited enforcement and deep-pocket risk-neutral lenders who provide state-contingent claims to households at zero risk premium. our model is different from the latter paper in that all investors in our economy are risk averse, and risk premiums are endogenous and time varying. gromb and vayanos  and brunnermeier and pedersen  study economies with cara investors subject to margin constraints, which have similarities with our constraints. in contrast to their models, in our model all investors have crra p and interest rates are endogenous. geanakoplos  , fostel and geanakoplos  , and geanakoplos and zame  develop the theory of collateral constraints in two- and three- period economies. our constraint prevents investors from defaulting in the worst-case scenario as in geanakoplos  and leads to higher asset prices as in g. chabakauri and b.y. han / journal of financial economics 138  754–776 757 fostel and geanakoplos  . simsek  studies a two-period economy with a continuum of states and shows that collateral constraints have asymmetric disci- plining effects, depending on investor’s beliefs, and also shows how defaultable debt endogenously emerges in equilibrium. biais et al.  study a two-period economy with multiple trees and imperfect collateral pledgeability. in contrast to this literature, we focus on the nonpledge- ability of labor income rather than the imperfect pledge- ability of assets. kehoe and levine  , kocherlakota  , tsyrennikov  , and osambela  study economies in which investors are weakly better off not defaulting and are permanently excluded from securities markets if they default. alvarez and jermann  show that such constraints can be implemented by imposing certain “not too tight” solvency portfolio constraints. alvarez and jermann  ﬁnd that such constraints help explain equity premiums in the us economy. they solve a simple example in closed form and develop a numerical method for the general case. in contrast to this literature, our in- vestors have limited liability and can re-enter the market after a default. our paper is related to the literature on the economic effects of borrowing, mar gin, short-sale, and position limit constraints (e.g., harrison and kreps, 1978; detemple and murthy, 1997; basak and cuoco, 1998; basak and croitoru, 20 0 0; 20 06; pavlova and rigobon, 2008; gârleanu and pedersen, 2011; chabakauri, 2013, 2015; rytchkov, 2014; brumm et al., 2015; buss et al., 2016 ), portfolio insurance  , and value at risk constraints (e.g., basak and shapiro, 2001 ). our economic results are dif- ferent from the results in this literature. first, the latter constraints can increase or decrease stock prices depend- ing on whether the investors’ risk aversions are greater or less than one , whereas our collat- eral constraints always increase stock prices irrespective of risk aversions and beliefs. second, these constraints typi- cally dampen stock return volatility, whereas our collateral constraints amplify them in some states of the economy. the paper is also related to macro-ﬁnance, ﬁnancial in- termediation, and banking literatures that study economies with frictions ( kiyotaki and moore, 1997; krusell and smith, 1998; brunnermeier and sannikov, 2014; klimenko et al., 2016; kondor and vayanos, 2019 ) and to the lit- erature on frictionless economies with heterogeneous in- vestors (e.g., chan and kogan, 20 02; basak, 20 05; yan, 2008; bhamra and uppal, 2014; atmaz and basak, 2018; massari, 2019; borovi ˇcka, 2020 , among others). 2. economic setup we consider a pure exchange inﬁnite-horizon economy with one consumption good produced by an exogenous lucas  tree. the economy is populated by two repre- sentative heterogeneous investors a and b that hold shares in the tree and receive labor income each period. to facili- tate the exposition, we start with a discrete-time economy with dates t = 0 , �t, 2�t, . . . , and later take a continuous- time limit. fig. 1. states of the economy. after time t the economy moves to a nor- mal state with probability 1 − λ�t and to a crisis state with probability λ�t . conditional on being in a normal state, the economy moves to either ω 1 or ω 2 with equal probabilities. at each point of time t = 0 , �t, 2�t, . . . the economy is in one of the three states: ω 1 , ω 2 , and ω 3 . with probabil- ity 1 − λ�t, the economy is either in state ω 1 or state ω 2 , which we call normal states, and with probability λ�t in state ω 3 , which we call the crisis state. parameter λ > 0 is the crisis intensity. states ω 1 and ω 2 have probabilities 1/2 conditional on the economy being in a normal state. fig. 1 depicts the structure of uncertainty. 2.1. output, ﬁnancial markets, and investor heterogeneity at date t , the tree produces d t �t units of aggregate out- put, where d t follows a process �d t = d t  ,   where μd ≥ 0 , σd > 0 and j d ≤ 0 are output growth mean, volatility, and drop during a crisis, respectively, and �d t = d t+�t − d t is the change in output. processes w t and j t are discrete-time analogs of a brownian motion and poisson processes, respectively. these processes follow dynamics w t+�t = w t + �w t and j t+�t = j t + � j t , where increments �w t and �j t are i.i.d. random variables given by �w t = ⎧ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩ + √ �t , in state ω 1 , − √ �t , in state ω 2 , 0 , in state ω 3 , � j t = ⎧ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎩ 0 , in state ω 1 , 0 , in state ω 2 , 1 , in state ω 3 .   it can be easily veriﬁed that e t  = 0 and var t  = �t, similar to a brownian motion, where e t  and var t  are expectation and variance con- ditional on time- t information. parameters μd , σd , and j d are such that d t > 0 for all t . chabakauri  shows that process  converges to a continuous-time lévy process as �t → 0. the economy is populated by two representative in- vestors a and b . each investor stands for a continuum of 758 g. chabakauri and b.y. han / journal of financial economics 138  754–776 identical investors of unit mass. fractions l a and l b of the aggregate output d t �t are paid to investors a and b as their labor incomes, respectively, and labor incomes are nontradable. fractions l a and l b can also be interpreted as nontradable shares in the aggregate output such as hold- ings of illiquid assets. the remaining fraction 1 − l a − l b is paid as a dividend to the shareholders. the investors can trade three securities at each date t :  a riskless bond in zero net supply, which pays one unit of consumption at date t + �t;  one stock in net supply of one unit, which is a claim to the stream of dividends  d t �t; and  a one-period insurance contract in zero net supply, which pays one unit of consumption in the crisis state ω 3 and zero otherwise. absent any frictions, the market is complete. market completeness and the ab- sence of idiosyncratic shocks to labor income are required for tractability and allow us to solve the model in closed form. bond, stock, and insurance prices b t , s t , and p t , re- spectively, are determined in equilibrium. 2.2. investor heterogeneity and optimization problems the investors have heterogeneous crra p  over consumption, given by u i  = ⎧ ⎨ ⎩ c 1 −γi 1 − γi , if γi ̸ = 1 , ln  , if γi = 1 ,   where i = a, b . the investors agree on time- t asset prices and the aggregate output but disagree on the probabilities of states. both investors have subjective beliefs given by πi  = 1 − λi �t 2 (1 + δi √ �t ) , πi  = 1 − λi �t 2 (1 − δi √ �t ) , πi  = λi �t,   where crisis intensities λi and disagreement parameters δi are such that probabilities  are positive. it is immedi- ate to verify that πi  + πi  + πi  = 1 , and hence π i  is a probability measure. throughout the paper, e i t  and var i t  denote conditional expectations and variances under the probability measure of investor i . it can be easily veriﬁed that time- t conditional expected output growth rate in normal times under the beliefs of investor i is given by e i t � �d t d t ����normal � = �t.   therefore, parameter δi measures the extent of investor i ’s pessimism  or optimism  rel- ative to the objective probability measure. for tractabil- ity, we assume that investors do not update probabilities over time. we also assume that investor b is weakly less risk averse and is more optimistic than investor a : γa ≥ γb , λa ≥ λb , and δb ≥ δa . the latter parametric restriction is imposed to simplify the exposition and does not affect the qualitative results in the paper. 1 1 this assumption makes it easier to see that the consumption share of investor a , s t = c ∗ a t /d t , is counter- at date 0 the investors have certain endowments of ﬁ- nancial assets. the total time- t disposable wealth of in- vestor i is given by w it + l i d t �t, where w it is the ﬁnancial wealth, deﬁned as the time- t value of all positions in ﬁ- nancial assets acquired at the previous date, and l i d t �t is the labor income. at date t , investor i allocates wealth to c it �t units of consumption, b it units of bond, and a portfo- lio of risky assets n it =  , where n i, s t and n i, p t are units of stock and insurance, respectively. in a frictionless economy, the ﬁnancial wealth w it can become negative when investors take risky positions backed by their future labor income. however, in our econ- omy only ﬁnancial assets are pledgeable, whereas labor in- comes are not. moreover, the investors have limited liabil- ity. that is, they can default when their ﬁnancial wealth becomes negative and then re-enter the market, which gives rise to a moral hazard problem, similar to the related literature . this problem is addressed here by requiring the investors to keep their next-period ﬁnancial wealth w i,t+�t positive at all times so that their pledgeable capital is suﬃcient to cover all liabilities such as debt and short positions. in- tuitively, constraint w i,t+�t ≥ 0 requires investors to cross- collateralize their pledgeable ﬁnancial assets in such a way that losses on one position are always offset by gains on the other positions. investor i = a, b maximizes expected discounted utility with time discount ρ max c it ,b it ,n it e i t � ∞ � τ= t e −ρτ u i �t � ,   subject to the self-ﬁnancing budget constraints, given by w it + l i d t �t = c it �t + b it b t + n it  ⊤ ,   w i,t+�t = b it + n it ×  d t+�t �t, 1 { ω t+�t = ω 3 } ) ⊤   and the collateral constraint w i,t+�t ≥ 0 ,   where w i,t+�t is the ﬁnancial wealth at date t + �t given by eq.  . to provide further intuition for the constraint  , fol- lowing gromb and vayanos  , we observe that it is equivalent to the following collateral constraint: w it + �t ≥ max ω t+ �t � n i, s t � s t − s t+ �t +  d t+ �t �t 1 + r t �t � + n i, p t � p t − 1 { ω t+�t = ω 3 } 1 + r t �t �� .   cyclical because in good  times less risk-averse optimists have more  wealth and consumption than more risk-averse pessimists. if this assumption is relaxed, all the qualitative results in this paper remain the same. section ia.2 of the internet appendix provides an example of equi- librium processes in an economy where the less risk-averse investor is more pessimistic than the more risk-averse investor and also presents the exact condition for the countercyclicality or procyclicality of the state variable s t . g. chabakauri and b.y. han / journal of financial economics 138  754–776 759 the constraint  is obtained by substituting bond hold- ing b it from eq.  into eq.  for wealth w i,t+�t and then rearranging terms in the inequality w i,t+�t ≥ 0 . the ex- pression on the right-hand side of the constraint  rep- resents the largest possible loss of a risky position evalu- ated in present-value terms. therefore, this constraint in- dicates that the investors are allowed to invest in portfo- lios of assets using these portfolios as collateral but are re- quired to put up a suﬃcient amount of their own capital to cover the losses in the worst-case scenario. the coeﬃcients multiplying asset holdings n i, s t and n i, p t in  and evalu- ated at the worst-case state ω t+�t are endogenous margin requirements that show the investors’ own capital invested per unit of asset. the constraint  is similar to collateral constraints in brunnermeier and pedersen  and gromb and vayanos  with the difference being that we allow investors to “cross-margin” their positions so that one risky asset can be used to cover margins on the other. brunnermeier and pedersen  discuss the institu- tional features of such constraints and point out that it is increasingly possible to “cross-margin.” remark 1 . our model can be easily extended to economies where fraction k i ∈ [0, 1] of investor i ’s labor income can be pledged. the require- ment to keep the next-period pledgeable wealth nonnega- tive is then given by w i,t+�t + k i l i 1 − l a − l b � s t+�t +  d t+�t �t � � �� � measure of pledgeable labor income ≥ 0 .   the second term in constraint  measures the value of the pledgeable income. let k i l i d t �t be the pledgeable in- come of investor i . this income is proportional to stock dividends  d t �t and hence can be replicated by a portfolio of � n i = k i l i /  units of stock with cum dividend value � n i  d t �t) . the investors can circumvent the nontradability of pledgeable income by shorting stocks against this income. hence, the claims to pledgeable income are, effectively, tradable and have the same value as the replicating portfolio. the requirement to have positive pledgeable wealth then becomes w i,t+�t + � n i  d t+�t �t) ≥ 0 , which is equivalent to constraint  . lemma a.1 in the appendix shows that models with k i ̸ = 0 reduce to models with k i = 0 by a change of variable. hence, the economic implications of our baseline model with constraint  and the model with a more general constraint  are the same. 2.3. equilibrium deﬁnition. an equilibrium is a set of asset prices { b t , s t , p t } and of consumption and portfolio policies { c ∗ it , b ∗ it , n ∗ it } i ∈{ a , b } that solve optimization problem  for each investor, given processes { b t , s t , p t }, and consumption and securities markets clear: c ∗ a t + c ∗ b t = d t , b ∗ a t + b ∗ b t = 0 , n ∗ a , s t + n ∗ b , s t = 1 , n ∗ a , p t + n ∗ b , p t = 0 .   in addition to asset prices, we derive p/d and wealth- consumption ratios � = s/  d ) and �i = w ∗ i /c ∗ i , respectively. we also derive the annualized �t -period risk- less interest rate r t , stock mean return μt and volatility σ t in normal times, and the percentage change of the stock price in the crisis state, denoted by j t . we derive the equilibrium in terms of state variable v t given by the log-ratio of marginal utilities of investors evaluated at their shares of the aggregate consumption c ∗ it /d t : v t = ln � (c ∗ a t /d t ) −γa (c ∗ b t /d t ) −γb � .   substituting consumption shares of investors a and b , de- noted by s t = c ∗ a t /d t and 1 − s t = c ∗ b t /d t , into eq.  , we express v t as a function of s t : v t = γb ln  − γa ln  .   variable v t is a decreasing function s t , and hence s t is an alternative state variable. we assume that the exogenous model parameters are such that e i t � e −ρ�t �d t+�t d t �1 −γi � < 1 , i = a, b.   condition  is necessary and suﬃcient for the existence of equilibrium in homogeneous agent economies populated only by investor a or investor b . 3. characterization of equilibrium in this section, we provide the characterization of equi- librium. first, we explain our methodology using a sim- ple example with logarithmic investors and no production crises. then, we extend the methodology to the general economy described in section 2 . finally, we derive asset prices and the distributions of investor a ’s consumption share s t in closed form in the continuous-time limit of the economy. 3.1. simple example and discussion of methodology we sketch our methodology in a simple economy with two logarithmic investors and without production crises  . the investors disagree about the probabil- ities of states ω 1 and ω 2 , given by eq.  , and have disagreement parameters δb = δ/ 2 and δa = −δ/ 2 , where δ > 0. we keep the derivation of equilibrium as close as possible to the derivation in the frictionless economy and clearly outline the sources of tractability of our model. first, we show that the optimal consumptions satisfy the ﬁrst order conditions  ξi,t+�t ξit = e −ρ�t (c ∗ i,t+�t ) −1 + ℓ i,t+�t (c ∗ it ) −1 , i = a, b,   where ξ it are the investors’ state price densities  and ℓ i,t+�t ≥ 0 are the lagrange multipliers for the collat- eral constraints w i,t+�t ≥ 0 . conditions  are derived in lemma 1 below using the standard method of lagrange 760 g. chabakauri and b.y. han / journal of financial economics 138  754–776 multipliers by maximizing the expected discounted utility  subject to the collateral constraint w i,t+�t ≥ 0 and the budget constraint rewritten in the present-value form as follows: c it �t + e i t �ξi,t+�t ξit w i,t+�t � = w it + l i d t �t.   the budget constraint  simply states that the sum of the current consumption and the present value of the next-period ﬁnancial wealth should be equal to the sum of the current ﬁnancial wealth and the labor income. next, we provide a heuristic derivation of the dynamics of the state variable  , which in the economy with log- investors is given by v t = ln (c ∗ b t /c ∗ a t ) . consider ﬁrst the un- constrained region of the state space where the lagrange multipliers ℓ i,t+�t vanish. then, the focs  are the same as in the frictionless economy. consequently, the dynamics of v t in that region is the same as in the frictionless econ- omy and is given by v t+�t = v t + μv �t + σv �w t , where μv = 0 and σv = δ + o . 2 let v and v denote the values of the state variable when the constraints of investors a and b bind, respectively. we argue below that variable v t follows dynamics v t+�t = max { v ; min { v ;v t + μv �t + σv �w t }} ,   where μv = 0 and σv = δ + o . the intuition for the dynamics  is that when the investors hit their con- straints they consume a fraction of labor income and can- not take risky positions that could lead to further ﬁnan- cial losses. hence, the constraints protect the investors’ consumption from falling below a certain limit. more for- mally, suppose investor a may hit the collateral constraint next period. similar to the derivation of the frictionless dynamics of variable v t , we ﬁnd that v t+�t = v t + μv �t + σv �w t − ln (1 + ℓ a,t+�t c ∗ a,t+�t ) , where ℓ a,t+�t ≥ 0 is the la- grange multiplier. hence, v t+�t = v < v t + μv �t + σv �w t if the constraint binds and v t+�t = v t + μv �t + σv �w t oth- erwise. the latter two cases imply that v t+�t = min { v , v t + μv �t + σv �w t } . a similar analysis for investor b gives rise to the lower bound v . combining the results, we obtain the dynamics  . the fact that the dynamics  of variable v t is a capped version of the unconstrained dynamics is the ﬁrst source of the tractability of our model. the second source of tractability is, as we show next, that the multipliers ℓ i,t+�t cancel out in the expressions for wealths w it . in particular, substituting spds in eq.  into the budget constraint  , we notice that the multiplier ℓ i,t+�t can- cels out due to the complementary slackness condition ℓ i,t+�t w i,t+�t = 0 for the constraint  , and the budget constraint becomes w it + l i d t �t = c it �t + e i t � e −ρ�t (c ∗ i,t+�t ) −1 (c ∗ it ) −1 w i,t+�t � .  2 when constraints do not bind and ℓ i,t+�t = 0 , focs  im- ply that v t+�t − v t = ln (c ∗ b , t+�t /c ∗ b t ) − ln (c ∗ a , t+�t /c ∗ a t ) = ln  − ln  . moreover, the spds are ratios of risk-neutral and phys- ical probabilities so that ξi,t+�t /ξit = π rn  /πi  . conse- quently, v t+�t − v t = ln  /πa ) . it can be directly veriﬁed that ln  /πa ) = μv �t + σv �w t , where μv = 0 and σv = ( ln (1 + 0 . 5 δ √ �t ) − ln (1 − 0 . 5 δ √ �t )) / √ �t = δ + o . from the market clearing condition c ∗ a t + c ∗ b t = d t and the expression v t = ln (c ∗ b t /c ∗ a t ) , we ﬁnd that c ∗ a t = d t / (1 + e v t ) and c ∗ b t = d t e v t /  . we also rewrite the ﬁnan- cial wealths as w it = �i  c ∗ it , where �i  is the wealth- consumption ratio of investor i , and substitute into the budget constraint  . in particular, for investor a , we ﬁnd that �a  = e a t ] + (1 − l a (1 + e v t ))�t.  we observe that when v t+�t ∈  , the dynamics of variable v t and eq.  are the same as in the frictionless economy. hence, taking limit �t → 0 and proceeding as in the frictionless case, by applying itô’s lemma or taylor expansions for small �t , we ﬁnd that ratio �a  satisﬁes the following equation inside the interval  : δ2 2 �′′ a  − δ2 2 �′ a  − ρ�a  + 1 − l a  = 0 .  the solution of eq.  is given by �a  = c a −e ϕ −v + c a + e ϕ + v + 1 − l a ρ − l a ρ e v ,   where ϕ ± = 0 . 5 ± � 1 + 8 ρ/δ2 and constants c a + and c a − can be found from the boundary conditions �′ a  = �′ a  = 0 . the latter boundary conditions can be derived using taylor expansions of eq.  near the boundaries. similarly, for investor b , �b  = � c b −e ϕ −v + c b + e ϕ + v + 1 − l b ρ e v − l b ρ � e −v .   the boundaries are found from the conditions w it = 0 or, equivalently, �a  = �b  = 0 . finally, we ﬁnd the p/d ratio �. from the market clearing conditions, s t = w a t + w b t . hence, ratio � can be expressed as �t = ) /  . after some algebra, using wealth-consumption ratios  and  , we ﬁnd that � = c −e ϕ −v + c + e ϕ + v 1 + e v + 1 ρ ,   where constants c ± are found in corollary 1 below from the boundary conditions. 3.2. equilibrium in the general case first, we derive the investors’ spds ξa t and ξb t deﬁned as processes such that asset prices can be expressed as fol- lows : b t = e i t �ξi,t+�t ξit � ,   s t = e i t �ξi,t+�t ξit  d t+�t �t) � ,   p t = e i

strategies with nonnegative payoffs are feasible under constraints g. chabakauri and b.y. han / journal of financial economics 138  754–776 761  – . the spds ξa t and ξb t differ due to differences in beliefs and are linked by the change of measure equation 3 ξb ,t+�t ξb t = ξa ,t+�t ξa t πa  πb  .   we ﬁnd the spds from the investor’s ﬁrst order conditions, reported in lemma 1 . lemma 1 . the spds ξ it and opti- mal consumptions c ∗ it satisfy the ﬁrst order conditions ξi,t+�t ξit = e −ρ�t (c ∗ i,t+�t ) −γi + ℓ i,t+�t (c ∗ it ) −γi ,   where ℓ i,t+�t ≥ 0 is the lagrange multiplier for collateral con- straint  satisfying the complementary slackness condition ℓ i,t+�t w ∗ i,t+�t = 0 . we use lemma 1 to derive the dynamics of state vari- able v t , similar to section 3.1 . when constraints do not bind, the lagrange multipliers ℓ i,t+�t vanish and the condi- tions  are the same as in a frictionless economy. con- sequently, the dynamics of the variable v t in the uncon- strained region of the state space is the same as in the frictionless economy. next, let v and v be the values of the state variable v t when constraints  of investors a and b bind, respectively. we show that state variable v t stays within boundaries v ≤ v t ≤ v because collateral constraints limit the investors’ losses of wealth and consumption. the boundaries v and v are found from the conditions w it = 0 , which are equivalent to �a  = 0 , �b  = 0 ,   where �i  are wealth-consumption ratios given by eqs.  and  in the appendix. proposition 1 be- low reports the dynamics of v t . proposition 1 (closed-form dynamics of the state variable v t ). given the boundaries v and v , the dynamics of the state variable v t is given by v t+�t = max { v ; min { v ;v t + μv �t + σv �w t + j v � j t }} ,   where drift μv , volatility σv , and jump j v are given in closed form by eqs.  – in the appendix. suppose γa ̸ = γb and/or δa ̸ = δb . then, for a suﬃciently small �t, the bound- aries v and v are reﬂecting (i.e. v t does not stay at the bound- aries forever). dynamics  reveals that the constraint does not al- ter the process for the state variable when the constraint does not bind, and the effects of constraints are captured by the bounds on process v t . this property of state variable v t plays an important role in establishing the clustering of volatilities and other results in section 4 below and is dif- ﬁcult to see using numerical methods. proposition ia.1 in the internet appendix proves the existence of ﬁnite time- independent bounds v and v satisfying eq.  . we use 3 eqs.  – can be rewritten as system equations for three un- knowns πi  ξi,t+�t  /ξit , where k = 1 , 2 , 3 for a ﬁxed i . the solution of this system is unique when the matrix of asset payoffs is invertible, and hence πb  ξb ,t+�t /ξb t = πa  ξa ,t+�t /ξa t for all states. the closed-form dynamics  to prove the existence and stationarity of equilibrium, derive the spds, and study the effects of collateralization on asset prices. proposition 2 be- low reports the spd, asset prices, and their properties. proposition 2 (state price density and the effects on asset prices).  the spd under the beliefs of investor a is given by ξa ,t+�t ξa t = e −ρ�t � s  s  d t+�t d t �−γa × exp  ,   where investor a’s time-t consumption share s  solves eq.  .  the p/d ratio � is uniformly bounded, the stock price s t is given by s t =  d t e a t � + ∞ � τ= t+�t ξa τ ξa t d τ d t � ,   and the prices of the bond and the insurance con- tract are given by b t = e a t  /ξa t and p t = e a t [ ξa ,t+�t 1 { ω t+�t = ω 3 } ] /ξa t , respectively.  the prices of bond, stock, and the insurance contract are higher in the economy with collateral constraints than in the frictionless economy, conditional on both economies having the same current output d t and the state variable v t . eq.  decomposes the spd into two terms. the ﬁrst term is the ratio of marginal utilities of investor a at dates t + �t and t , e −ρ�t  d t+�t ) −γa /  d t ) −γa , and is the same as in the frictionless economy. the second term captures the effect of the friction on the spd and is only activated when the constraint of investor a is binding. the spd of investor b can be obtained along the same lines. proposition 2 also demonstrates that collateralization inﬂates asset prices. this is because the spd in the con- strained economy exceeds its counterpart in the fric- tionless economy due to the positive lagrange multiplier ℓ i,t+�t in the ﬁrst order condition  . we discuss the in- tuition in section 4.1 . proposition ia.2 in the internet ap- pendix provides the veriﬁcation theorem for the optimality of investors’ optimal strategies. 3.3. closed-form solution in a continuous-time limit next we take continuous-time limit �t → 0 and de- rive the equilibrium in closed form. taking the limit al- lows rewriting the equations for the p/d and wealth- consumption ratios as differential difference equations. for tractability, we derive these ratios in terms of a trans- formed ratio � � , which satisﬁes a simpler equation reported in lemma 2 . lemma 2 . in the limit �t → 0, the p/d ratio � and wealth-consumption ratios �i are given by � = � � s  γa ,   762 g. chabakauri and b.y. han / journal of financial economics 138  754–776 �i  =  � � +  � �  1 { i = a } s  + 1 { i = b } ) s  γa ,   where s  solves eq.  and � � satisﬁes a differential difference equation � σ 2 v 2 � �′′  + � � μv + δa � σv +  σd � σv � � �′  − � λa + ρ −  +  γa 2 σ 2 d � � �  + λa  1 −γa � �( max { v ;v + � j v }

δ2 b 2 ,   � σv =  σd + δb − δa ,   � j v =  ln  + ln �λb λa � .   the boundaries v and v solve equations � �  � �  = l a , � �  � �  = 1 − l b .   we observe that eq.  is linear, in contrast to economies with constraints directly imposed on trading strategies of investors (e.g., gârleanu and pedersen, 2011; chabakauri, 2013, 2015; rytchkov, 2014 ) and is a differen- tial difference equation with a “delayed” argument v + � j v in the fourth term, where � j v ≤ 0 . this term is further com- plicated by the fact that the argument is restricted to stay above the boundary v , which gives rise to the term with a peculiar argument max { v ;v + � j v } . this term captures the investors’ decisions in anticipation of hitting their con- straint. before deriving the equilibrium in the general case, we provide analytical p/d ratios for a special case in corollary 1 below. corollary 1 . suppose λa = λb = λ > 0 and γa = γb = γ , where γ is an integer. then, the p/d ratio � is given by � = 1  γ � c −e ϕ −v + c + e ϕ + v + γ � k =0 �γ k � e k v /γ h  � ,   where h  is a characteristic polynomial of eq.  given by h  = ρ −   +  γ 2 σ 2 d + λ 1 −γ ) − ( � μv + δa � σv +  σd � σv ) ϕ − � σ 2 v ϕ 2 2 ,   where ϕ − and ϕ + are a negative and positive solu- tions of equation h  = 0 and constants c ± are given by eqs.  – in the appendix, respectively. in section 4 below, we argue that the analytical ratio  captures some important properties of the p/d ratio, which also holds in the general case with arbitrary risk aversions and crises intensities. hence, this special case can be used as a tractable benchmark in asset pricing re- search. proposition ia.3 in the internet appendix presents the closed-form p/d ratio for general crra risk aversions and beliefs. although the general closed-form solution is complex, it provides a constructive proof for the existence of p/d ratios. we also solve eqs.  – for the ratio � � using the method of ﬁnite differences and double-check that the numerical and closed-form solutions coincide. we call the interval v ∈ [ v , v −� j v ] in the state space a period of anxious economy, similar to fostel and geanako- plos  , albeit the investor disagreement does not in- crease during these periods as in the latter paper. when the economy falls into this state, even a small possibil- ity of a crisis renders the collateral constraint binding and leads to deleveraging. to explore the economic effects of the anxious economy, using the spd  , we derive the interest rates r t and stock risk premium in normal times μt − r t in proposition 3 below. proposition 3 . for a suﬃciently small interval �t, the interest rate r t and the risk premium μt − r t in normal times are given by r t = ⎧ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩ ˜ r t + λa − λa  −γa � s

754–776 763 �t ≡ γa γb /  + γb s t ) is the risk aversion of a repre- sentative investor. the effects of collateral constraints on interest rates and risk premiums arise due to the investors’ concern that a potential crisis can render the constraint binding next pe- riod when the economy is close to boundary v . the third term in the ﬁrst line of eq.  for the interest rate quan- tiﬁes the impact of collateralization on precautionary sav- ings due to a downward jump in the aggregate consump- tion, which we further discuss in section 4 . interest rate  and risk premium  also feature terms with indicator functions 1 { v = v } and 1 { v = v } , which are nonzero only at the boundaries v and v . for the interest rate r t these terms have the order of magnitude propor- tional to 1 / √ �t , and hence the interest rate has singu- larities at the boundaries v and v when �t → 0. the in- tuition is that near the boundaries v and v even a small shock �w t can lead to a default. thus, when the investor’s constraint binds at time t , this investor allocates a larger fraction of income to the riskless asset than in the interior region v < v t < v , which decreases interest rates. similar singularities arise in a continuous-time model of detemple and serrat  . our discrete-time analysis sheds new light on these singularities by uncovering their order of magnitude 1 / √ �t . consequently, the per-period rate r t �t is ﬁnite and has an order of magnitude o ( √ �t ) . moreover, in contrast to the latter paper, due to production crises, the collateralization in our model affects the interest rates and risk premiums not only at the boundaries but also for the whole period of anxious economy. 3.4. stationary distribution of consumption share absent any frictions, the state variable v follows an arithmetic brownian motion with a jump. this process is nonstationary and induces nonstationarity in the uncon- strained equilibrium where one of the investor’s consump- tion share gradually converges to zero. as a result, with the exception of some knife-edge parameter combinations, only one of the investors has a signiﬁcant impact on as- set prices in the frictionless economy in the long run (e.g., blume and easley, 2006; yan, 2008; chabakauri, 2015 ). collateral constraints  help both investors survive in the long run by protecting them against losing their shares of aggregate consumption beyond certain limits, similar to the previous literature on survival (e.g., blume and easley, 2006; cao, 2018 , among others). our contribution is that we derive the probability density function  of con- sumption share s in closed form, show that this pdf is sta- tionary and nondegenerate, and ﬁnd parameters that de- termine its shape. the latter result is important because it implies nontrivial time variation of asset prices in the long run. for tractability, we assume that there are no produc- tion crises so that λa = λb = 0 . proposition 4 reports the results. proposition 4 (stationary distribution of consumption share). suppose λa = λb = 0 . then, the pdf f  of consumption share s at time τ conditional on observing share s t at time t is given in closed form by expression  in the appendix. furthermore, the stationary pdf of consump- tion share s is given by f = ⎧ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎩ 2 � μv � σ 2 v �γa s + γb 1 − s � ×

eq.  for v and v , respectively. proposition 4 conﬁrms that both investors survive in the long run and consumption share s has a well-deﬁned stationary distribution. the beliefs enter pdf  via the ratio of the drift and variance of process v t , given by � μv / � σ 2 v . this ratio determines the relative dominance of in- vestors in the economy. in particular, for bounds s and s that are symmetric around 0.5, the pdf is concentrated around s if � μv > 0 and around s if � μv < 0 . we note that the drift of state variable v can be rewritten as � μv = (γa − γb )(μd − σ 2 d / 2) +  / 2 , and hence the drift is inﬂuenced both by the dispersion of beliefs δa − δb and the average bias  / 2 . in the special case γa = γb the relative dominance of investors is determined by a simple ratio of the average bias and the dispersion of beliefs: � μv � σ 2 v =  / 2 δb − δa .   in another special case where risk aversions are different but beliefs are correct on average, i.e.  / 2 = 0 , the drift � μv is determined by differences in risk aversions. fig. 2 a shows the stationary pdf and transition densi- ties f  when investors have the same risk aver- sions γa = γb = 2 and opposite beliefs δa = −δb = −0 . 05 . other model parameters are described in the legend of the ﬁgure. from eq.  for the expected dividend growth rate, we observe that the latter disagreement parameters δi imply that investor a  believes that expected out- put growth is approximately 10% lower  than un- der the true probabilities. the stationary pdf is symmetric and bimodal so that both investors occasionally have large consumption shares. fig. 2 b shows two additional distri- butions when investor a has correct beliefs  and investor b is optimistic . in the case γa = γb = 2 , δa = 0 , and δb = 0 . 05 , the stationary distribution peaks at s = 0 . 9 , which means that the rational investor a has large consumption share in the economy. in the case γa = 2 , γb = 1 . 5 , δa = 0 , and δb = 0 . 15 , the stationary distribution is bimodal so that both rational and overly optimistic in- vestors occasionally have large consumption shares in the economy. the economic implication of the bimodality of the sta- tionary pdf under some model parameters is that the pe- riods of binding constraints are likely to be persistent. the 764 g. chabakauri and b.y. han / journal of financial economics 138  754–776 fig. 2. convergence to stationary distribution of consumption share s t = c ∗ a ,t /d t . panel  shows transition densities f  for the starting point s 0 = 0 . 5 and the stationary distribution f  . we set γa = 2 , γb = 2 , μd = 0 . 018 , σd = 0 . 032 , λa = λb = 0 , ρ = 0 . 02 , δa = −0 . 05 (i.e., e a  ≈ 0 . 9 μd ), δb = 0 . 05 (i.e., e b  ≈ 1 . 1 μd ), s = 0 . 1 , s = 0 . 9 , l a = 0 . 1257 , and l b = 0 . 1178 . panel  shows stationary distribu- tions for different sets of model parameters. closed-form dynamics  for the state variable v helps explain the bimodality of the pdf. from this dynamics, we observe that after hitting a boundary, the process v t re- mains in its vicinity for some time. hence, because vari- able v follows an arithmetic brownian motion in the in- terval  , the probability of hitting the same boundary again is high. 4. analysis of equilibrium in this section, we demonstrate the economic implica- tions of our model. in section 4.1 , we show that capital constraints amplify the effect of rare crises on generat- ing lower interest rates and higher sharpe ratios, lead to spikes and crashes of stock prices and stock return volatili- ties, amplify volatility in good times and decrease it in bad times, and generate volatility clusters. section 4.2 mea- sures the economic signiﬁcance of collateralization by quantifying the collateral premium of the stock. we study the equilibrium for calibrated parameters. we set the parameters of the aggregate consumption process to μd = 0 . 018 , σd = 0 . 032 , and j d = −0 . 25 and the crisis intensities of investors a and b to λa = 0 . 02 and λb = 0 . 01 , respectively. the risk aversions are γa = γb = 2 , and the time discount is ρ = 0 . 02 . the disagreement parameters are δa = −δb = −0 . 05 , and they correspond to the case in which investor a  believes that the mean growth rate given by eq.  is approximately equal to 0 . 9 μd . the shares of labor income l a = 0 . 1257 and l b = 0 . 1178 are chosen to generate symmetric bounds on investor a ’s con- sumption share: s = 0 . 1 and s = 0 . 9 . 4 we note that all our qualitative results on interest rates, market prices of risk, 4 drift μd and volatility σd are within the ranges considered in the lit- erature (e.g., basak and cuoco, 1998; chan and kogan, 2002; rytchkov, 2014 ). to avoid ﬁnding bounds s and s numerically, we set them exoge- nously to s = 0 . 1 and s = 0 . 9 and then recover the shares of labor in- comes l a = 0 . 1257 and l b = 0 . 1178 , which imply these bounds in equilib- p/d ratios, and stock return volatilities remain the same when investors have different risk aversions and identical beliefs or when both risk aversions and beliefs are differ- ent. moreover, the results do not depend on whether the more risk-averse investor is more pessimistic or optimistic than the less risk-averse investor. 5 we plot the equilibrium processes as functions of con- sumption share s t = c ∗ a t /d t because s conveniently lies in the interval  and is more intuitive than variable v . we observe that consumption share s is countercyclical in the sense that corr t  < 0 . intuitively, the aggregate wealth and consumption shift to  investor a following negative  shocks to output because this investor is more pessimistic than investor b . we call a pro- cess procyclical  if that process is a de- creasing  function of s . we interpret periods of low  s t as good  times in the economy because during these periods the output d t is high . 4.1. equilibrium processes fig. 3 depicts investor b ’s leverage/market ratio l t / s t and stock holdings n b t in the constrained  and unconstrained  economies. fig. 3 a demon- strates the cyclicality of leverage. the leverage is low- rium. first, we ﬁnd v and v from eq.  for state variable v and then ﬁnd l a and l b from eq.  for the boundaries. 5 section ia.2 of the internet appendix presents two additional exam- ples of equilibria. the ﬁrst example shows the equilibrium processes in the economy where investors have different risk aversions but identical beliefs. the second example shows these processes when both risk aver- sions and beliefs are different, and the less risk-averse investor is also more pessimistic than the more risk-averse investor. the equilibrium pro- cesses in these economies have the same features as the processes in our baseline calibration in section 4.1 . in particular, interest rates are lower and sharpe ratios are higher during anxious times, the price dividend ra- tios are u-shaped and sensitive to small shocks near the boundaries s and s , and stock return volatilities are higher in good times and lower in bad times. g. chabakauri and b.y. han / journal of financial economics 138  754–776

, γb = 2 , ρ = 0 . 02 , μd = 0 . 018 , σd = 0 . 032 , j d = −0 . 25 , λa = 0 . 02 , λb = 0 . 01 , δa = −0 . 05 , δb = 0 . 05 , s = 0 . 1 , s = 0 . 9 , l a = 0 . 1257 , and l b = 0 . 1178 . est when either investor a or investor b bind on their constraints. intuitively, when s = s , investor b ’s ﬁnancial wealth is zero, and hence b lacks collateral and cannot borrow. when s = s , investor a ’s ﬁnancial wealth is zero and the labor income l a d t �t is inﬁnitesimally small in the continuous-time limit. the liquidity dries up because investor a cannot supply credit. the leverage cycles are present only in the constrained economy and do not occur in the unconstrained economy where the state variable s is nonstationary and gradually converges to zero or one. fig. 3 b presents the number of stocks held by investor b . consider ﬁrst the unconstrained economy with pledge- able labor income. from fig. 3 b, we observe that the optimistic investor b shorts stocks in the unconstrained economy when consumption share s is close to one. the intuition is that in bad times, following a sequence of neg- ative shocks to output, investor b shorts stocks to ﬁnance consumption and backs short positions by the pledge- able labor income. the stream of labor income l b d t �t is equivalent to dividends from holding � n b = l b /  units of nontradable shares in the lucas tree. short-selling allows the investors to circumvent the nontradability of labor income and to freely adjust the effective share ˆ n b + n b , s t in the lucas tree. overcoming the nontradability of labor incomes makes this economy similar to the non- stationary unconstrained economy. the ﬁnancial wealth can then become negative. in the constrained economy, the nonnegative wealth constraint precludes investor b from shorting. the trading strategy of investor a equals 1 − n ∗ b t in equilibrium and can be analyzed similarly. in- vestor a also has an additional motive to short stocks due to being more pessimistic than investor b . fig. 4 depicts the interest rate r t , sharpe ratio (μt − r t ) /σt , p/d ratio �, and excess stock return volatility (σt − σd ) /σd in the constrained  and unconstrained  economies. fig. 4 a shows the interest rate r t . 6 6 we exclude the singularities in the dynamics of r t and focus on the dynamics in the unconstrained region because the economy spends an inﬁnitesimal amount of time at the boundaries. the interest rate declines sharply when the economy en- ters into an anxious state close to the boundary s where even a small possibility of a crisis next period makes the constraint of investor b binding. the intuition is as fol- lows. in the unconstrained economy, a crisis around state s generates wealth transfer to the pessimistic investor a and increases her consumption share s above s . in the con- strained economy, consumption share s is capped by s . consequently, following a crisis, investor a ’s marginal util- ity (c ∗ a ) −γa is higher in the constrained than in the uncon- strained economy. as a result, investor a is more willing to smooth consumption in the constrained economy, and hence the interest rate declines due to the precautionary savings motive. in particular, the investor buys more bonds, which drives interest rates down. fig. 4 b shows that the sharpe ratio increases to compensate investor a for buying risky assets from investor b in bad times when consump- tion share s is large and slightly decreases in good times due to high volatility . we note that the decreases in interest rates and increases in sharpe ra- tios during anxious times arise only when both the crises and the constraints are simultaneously present, and hence the crises and constraints reinforce the effects of each other. eq.  for the interest rate and eq.  for the risk premium show that absent any crises , the constraints affect r t and μt − r t only at the boundaries of the state space. from fig. 4 c, we observe that the collateral constraints increase p/d ratio � relative to the unconstrained econ- omy, in line with proposition 2. the p/d ratio is also a de- creasing  function of consumption share s near the boundary s , which makes it u-shaped and sensitive to small shocks when the constraints are likely to bind. proposition ia.5 in the internet appendix shows that the latter property holds for all model parameters under which the equilibrium exists. we further note that p/d ratio � in fig. 4 c is a convex function of consumption share s , which reinforces its resemblance to a u-shape. proposition ia.5 also establishes suﬃcient conditions for the convex- ity of the p/d ratio in the unconstrained economy �unc 766 g. chabakauri and b.y. han / journal of financial economics 138

 and unconstrained  economies. the model parameters are the same as in fig. 3 . and the difference � − �unc . ratio � is then convex as the sum of the latter two convex components. in particu- lar, proposition ia.5 shows that ratio �unc is convex when γa = γb ≥ 1 , and the difference � − �unc is convex under an additional restriction on crises intensities λa = λb > 0  . 7 we note that the latter conditions are satisﬁed for the analytical p/d ratio  in corollary 1 . next, we discuss the intuition for the fact that p/d ratios in the constrained economy increase more at the boundaries than in the interior of the interval  and are decreasing  functions of consumption share s near s  . suppose consumption share s is close to the boundary s , where investor b ’s constraint is binding but in- vestor a is unconstrained. because investor a ’s constraint is loose, the spd ξa t is proportional to investor a ’s marginal utility (c ∗ a t ) −γa . in the constrained economy the consump- tion share of investor a is capped at s < 1 , whereas in the unconstrained economy it can increase above s . therefore, the marginal utility of investor a , and hence the spd are expected to be higher in the constrained than in the un- 7 a nonconvex ratio � emerges, for example, when γa = γb < 1 and s = 0 . 01 and s = 0 . 99 because the corresponding unconstrained p/d ratio �unc is concave, and ratio � closely follows its contour inside the interval  and then spikes up at the boundaries, giving rise to nonconvexities. constrained economy. hence, stocks are more valuable in the constrained economy around the boundary s . the intu- ition around s can be analyzed in a similar way. an addi- tional economic force  con- tributing to a higher stock price is that the stock can be used as collateral that helps relax the constraint, which gives rise to a premium. the results in fig. 4 d demonstrate that the constraint makes volatility more procyclical, reducing it in bad times  and increasing it in good times . this is because u-shaped p/d ratio in the constrained econ- omy is more procyclical in good times  and more countercyclical in bad times  than in the unconstrained economy. stock price s t = �t d t is more volatile in good times  because both �t and d t change in the same direction and is less volatile in bad times  because �t and d t change in opposite di- rections and partially offset the effects of each other. lower volatility in bad times is in line with the previous literature on the effects of portfolio constraints on asset prices (e.g., chabakauri, 2013, 2015; brunnermeier and sannikov, 2014 , among others). the empirical literature ﬁnds that volatil- ity tends to be higher in bad times . however, high volatility can be explained by high uncer- tainty about the economic growth and learning effects in bad times , which we do not study in g. chabakauri and b.y. han / journal of financial economics 138  754–776 767 fig. 5. simulated p/d ratio � and stock return volatility σ over time. panels  and  show the spikes and crashes of simulated p/d ratio and volatility σ , and clustering of volatility σ over the period of 50 years. the model parameters are the same as in fig. 3 . this paper to focus on the effects of collateral constraints that are not confounded by other effects. boundary conditions  allow us to explore volatility σt near the boundaries s and s using closed-form expres- sions in corollary 2 below. corollary 2 . stock return volatility in normal times σ t satisﬁes the following boundary conditions: σ  = σd + γb s � σv γa  + γb s > σd , σ  = σd − γa  � σv γa  + γb s < σd .   by continuity, inequalities  also hold in the vicinity of the boundaries. fig. 4 d shows that volatility σ t is steep at the boundaries: it spikes close to s and crashes close to s , consistent with corollary 2. it also evolves in three regimes of low, medium, and high volatility, which resem- bles volatility clustering documented in the empirical liter- ature . the distribution of consump- tion share s in fig. 2 implies that the economy persists in these clusters for some time. fig. 5 plots the simulated dynamics of the p/d ratio and stock return volatility over a period of 50 years. consis- tent with our discussion above, the dynamics of the p/d ra- tio in fig. 4 a exhibits intervals of booms and busts around the times when the collateral constraints become binding. these intervals resemble periods of inﬂating and deﬂating bubbles in the economy. the volatility σ in fig. 4 b evolves in clusters of high and low volatility, as explained above. 4.2. collateral liquidity premium in this section, we measure the liquidity premium of stocks over labor income arising because stocks can be used as collateral. we consider a marginal representative investor i that does not affect asset prices and charac- terize this investor’s shadow indifference price � s it of la- bor income. we deﬁne � s it as the price such that exchang- ing marginal �l i claims to the stream of labor income for � s it �l i units of wealth leaves the investor’s utility un- changed. consider the investor i ’s value function v i ( w it , v t ; l i ). price � s it is the solution of equation v i (w ∗ it , v t ; l i ) = v i (w ∗ it + � s it �l i , v t ; l i − �l i ) . in the limit �l i → 0, we ﬁnd that � s it = ∂v i (w ∗ it , v t ; l i ) / ∂l i ∂v i (w ∗ it , v t ; l i ) / ∂w it .   the deﬁnition of shadow indifference price � s it comes from the literature on the valuation of derivative securities in incomplete markets . the labor incomes l i d t �t are proportional to dividends  d t �t. therefore, if claims on labor incomes were tradable and pledgeable, shadow price � s it would have been equal to s t /  . however, labor incomes are nontradable and nonpledgeable. hence, from the view of investor i , the stock enjoys a liquidity premium, deﬁned as �it = s t /  − � s it s t /  .   we ﬁnd derivatives in eq.  using the envelope the- orem. then, we derive prices � s it and show that premiums  are positive and large. proposition 5 reports our re- sults. proposition 5 . in the limit �t → 0, investor i ′ s shadow price of a unit of labor income is given by � s it = � �i  s  γa d t , i = a, b,   where � �i  satisﬁes differential difference eq.  subject to the following boundary conditions for investors a and b � �′ a  = 0 , � �′ a  = 0 ,   � �′ b  = � �b  , � �′ b  = � �b  .   the investors’ liquidity premiums for stocks �a and �b are positive, and hence s t /  > � s a t , s t /  > � s b t .   768 g. chabakauri and b.y. han / journal of financial economics 138  754–776 fig. 6. collateral liquidity premiums from the view of investors a and b . the ﬁgure shows the collateral liquidity premiums  of stocks over nonpledge- able labor incomes from the view of investors a and b for different sets of risk aversions and beliefs. all other model parameters are the same as in fig. 3 . the premium �it > 0 arises because the stock can be used as collateral, whereas the labor income cannot. we note that this premium is zero in the frictionless econ- omy, and hence the nontradability of labor income and the possibility of shorting stocks do not contribute to the premium. this is because, as discussed in section 4.1 , in an unconstrained economy with fully pledgeable labor in- come the investors can circumvent the nontradability of labor income by shorting stocks. we further remark that the shadow prices and liquidity premiums can be found in closed form, similar to stock prices in section 3 , but we do not present them for brevity. fig. 6 a and b plot the liquidity premiums  for in- vestors a and b , respectively, for different values of risk aversions and beliefs, with other model parameters being the same as in section 4.1 . we observe that investors a and b have different valuations of their labor incomes due to differences in p and beliefs. their premiums �i are close to zero when the investors are far away from the boundaries where their respective constraints become binding. the premiums increase up to 40%, close to the boundaries where the stock is more valuable for the pur- poses of relaxing the constraints. large premiums �it im- ply the economic signiﬁcance of stock pledgeability. the premiums are smallest for the case γa = γb = 2 , δa = 0 , and δb = 0 . 05 because the economy in this case is closer to the homogeneous-agent economies than in the other cases depicted in fig. 6 . 5. conclusion we develop a parsimonious and tractable theory of asset pricing under collateral constraints. we show that requiring investors to collateralize their trades gives rise to rich dynamics of asset prices and their moments. the constraints lead to booms and busts in stock prices; cause spikes, crashes, and clustering of volatilities; amplify volatilities in good states and dampen them in bad states; decrease interest rates and increase sharpe ratios when optimistic investors are close to default boundaries; and induce cycles of high and low leverage. the tractability of our model allows us to obtain asset prices and the distri- butions of consumption shares in closed form. appendix a. proofs lemma a.1 . let � n i = k i l i /  . the maximization of expected discounted utility  subject to budget constraints  and  and constraint  is equiva- lent to maximizing  with

self- ﬁnancing budget constraints. ■ lemma a.2 .  let v i  denote the value function of investor i, where v t is the state variable. then, the value func- tion solves the following equation of dynamic program- ming: v i  = max c it { u i  �t + e −ρ�t e i t  ] � ,   g. chabakauri and b.y. han / journal of financial economics 138  754–776 769 subject to the static budget and collateral con- straints: w it + l i d t �t = c it �t + e i t �ξi,t+�t ξit w i,t+�t � ,   w i, t+�t ≥ 0 .    value function v i  is a concave function of wealth w it . proof of lemma a.2.  we start by demonstrating the equivalence of the dynamic and static budget constraints  -  and  , re- spectively. multiplying eq.  by ξi,t+�t /ξit , taking expec- tation operator e i t  on both sides, and using eq.  –  for asset prices, we obtain e i t �ξi, t+�t ξit w i,t+�t � = b it b t + n it  ⊤ .   from the budget constraint  , we observe that the right- hand side of  equals w it + l i d t �t, and hence we ob- tain the static budget constraint  . conversely, if there exists w i,t+�t satisfying constraints  and  , there exist trading strategies b it and n it that replicate w i,t+�t be- cause the underlying market is effectively complete (i.e., the payoff matrix is invertible). finally, the dynamic pro- gramming eq.  is obtained by rewriting the optimiza- tion problem  in a recursive form.  consider wealth levels w it and � w it . let { c ∗ it , b ∗ it , n ∗ it } and { � c ∗ it , � b ∗ it , � n ∗ it } be optimal consumptions and portfolios that correspond to w it and � w it , respectively, and satisfy constraints  – . for any α ∈ , policies { α� c ∗ it + (1 − α) c ∗ it , α� b ∗ it +  b ∗ it , α� n ∗ it +  n ∗ it } are admissible for wealth αw it +  � w it . by concavity of crra utilities v i  � w

proof of lemma 1. consider the lagrangian for the opti- mization problem  subject to constraints  and  : l = u i �t + e −ρ�t e i t � v i  � + ηit � w it + l i d t �t − c it �t − e i t �ξi,t+�t ξit w

respect to c it and w i,t+�t , we ob- tain u ′ i (c ∗ it ) = ηit ,   e −ρ�t �∂v i  ∂w + ℓ i,t+�t � = ηit ξi,t+�t ξit .   by the envelope theorem , ∂v i  ∂w = u ′ i (c ∗ i,t+�t ) .   substituting the partial derivative of the value function  and the marginal utility  into eq.  , and then dividing both sides of the equation by u ′ i (c ∗ it ) , we ob- tain the spd  . ■ proof of proposition 1. step 1. consider the case in which constraints do not bind, and hence ℓ i,t+�t = 0 . then, using eq.  for the state variable v t and the ﬁrst order conditions  , we ob- tain v t+�t − v t = ln �(c ∗ a ,t+�t /c ∗ a t ) −γa (c ∗ b ,t+�t /c ∗ b t ) −γb �d t+�t d t �γa −γb � = ln �ξa ,t+�t /ξa t ξb ,t+�t /ξb t �d t+�t d t �γa −γb � .   from the above equation and the change of measure eq.  , which relates spds ξa ,t+�t and ξb ,t+�t , we obtain the dynamics of v t when constraints do not bind: v t+�t − v t = ln �πb  πa  �d t+�t d t �γa −γb � .   let v and v be the boundaries satisfying eq.  , at which the constraints of investors a and b bind, respec- tively. let investor a ’s constraint be binding so that v t+�t = v , and hence ℓ a ,t+�t ≥ 0 . using eq.  for v t , ﬁrst order conditions  , and ℓ a ,t+�t ≥ 0 , we obtain v − v t ≤ ln �((c ∗ a ,t+�t ) −γa + ℓ a ,t+�t ) / (c ∗ a t ) −γa (c ∗ b ,t+�t /c ∗ b t ) −γb �d t+�t d t �γa −γb � = ln �ξa ,t+�t /ξa t ξb ,t+�t /ξb t �d t+�t d t �γa −γb � = ln �πb  πa  �d t+�t d t �γa −γb � .   similarly, for v t+�t = v , we ﬁnd that v − v t ≥ ln  / πa   γa −γb ) . the latter two inequalities imply that when the constraint binds, v t+�t is given by v t+�t = max � v ; min � v ;v t + ln � πb  πa  � d t+�t d t �γa −γb ��� .   we observe that  is also satisﬁed in the uncon- strained case in which v < v t+�t < v . it remains to prove that v t does not escape  interval. consider a marginal investor of type a . we conjecture that v t follows dynamics 770 g. chabakauri and b.y. han / journal of financial economics 138  754–776  and verify that the consumption choice of investor a indeed implies this dynamics. the analysis for investor b is similar. we have shown above that v t satisﬁes inequality  when investor a is constrained. now, we show the opposite: investor a is constrained when v t satisﬁes  . hence, v t+�t cannot exceed v . consider v t such that v t + ln �πb  /πa   γa −γb � > v for some ω t+�t and v t ∈  . because v < v t < v , investor a consumes c ∗ a t = s  d t , as shown above. we show that the constraint of investor a binds and c ∗ a ,t+�t = s  d t+�t . this consumption level conﬁrms that v t+�t = v is indeed an equilibrium outcome. consider the constraint of investor a at date t in the state ω t+�t where v t+�t = v : w a ,t+�t ≥ 0 ≡ �a  s  d t+�t ,   where the last equality holds by the deﬁnition of v . using the concavity of the value function, proven in lemma 1 , and condition  from the envelope theorem, we ob- tain u ′ a (c ∗ a ,t+�t ) = ∂v a  ∂w ≤ ∂v a  s  d t+�t , v ; l a ) ∂w = u ′ a  d t+�t ) .   because u ′ i  is a decreasing function, we ﬁnd that c ∗ a ,t+�t /d t+�t ≥ s  . investor b is unconstrained when v t+�t = v and hence has spd ξb ,t+�t ξb t = e −ρ�t �c ∗ b ,t+�t c ∗ b t �−γb = e −ρ�t � ) d t+�t  ) d t �−γb .   from the change of measure eq.  and the foc  , the spd of investor a is ξa ,t+�t ξa t = ξb ,t+�t ξb t πb  πa  = e −ρ�t (c ∗ a ,t+�t ) −γa + ℓ a ,t+�t (c ∗ a t ) −γa .   from  and  , we ﬁnd the lagrange multiplier: l a ,t+�t (c ∗ a ,t+�t ) −γa = � c ∗ a ,t+�t c ∗ a t �γa � ) d t+�t  ) d t �−γb πb  πa  − 1 ≥ � s  d t+�t s  d t �γa � ) d t+�t  ) d t �−γb πb  πa  − 1 = � πb  πa  � d t+�t d t �γa −γb � e v t −v − 1 > 0 .  the ﬁrst inequality follows from the fact that c ∗ a ,t+�t ≥ s  d t+�t , which we proved above. the second equal- ity holds by the deﬁnition of state variable  . the second inequality comes from the assumption that v t + ln �πb  /πa   γa −γb � > v . hence, the lagrange multiplier l a ,t+�t is strictly positive. from the complementary slackness condition, the constraint  must be binding. therefore, inequality  be- comes an equality, and hence c ∗ a ,t+�t = s  d t+�t . step 2. we now look for coeﬃcients μv , σv and j v such that μv �t + σv �w t + j v � j t = ln �πb  πa  �d t+�t d t �γa −γb � = ln �πb  πa  � +  ln  .  we write identity  in each of the states ω t+�t ∈ { ω 1 , ω 2 , ω 3 } and obtain a system of three linear equations with three unknowns μv , σv and j v . solving this system, we ﬁnd μv = 1 2�t �  ln  2 − σ 2 d �t ] + ln � 1 − λb �t 1 − λa �t �2 + ln � 1 − δ2 b �t 1 − δ2 a �t �� ,   σv = 1 2 √ �t �  ln � 1 + μd �t + σd √

suﬃciently small �t . assume that σv > 0; the case σv < 0 is considered analogously. then, for a suﬃciently small �t , we observe that μv �t − σv √ �t < 0 and μv �t + σv √ �t > 0 because √ �t -terms dominate �t -terms, and as �t → 0, μv → � μv and σv → � σv , where � μv and � σv are given by eqs.  and  , respectively. moreover, � σv > 0 be- cause γa ≥ γb and δb ≥ δa , and at least one of the latter inequalities is strict. then, the boundaries are reﬂecting because  if v t = v , then v t+�t = v + μv �t − σv √ �t < v with positive probability, and  if v t = v , then v t+�t = v + μv �t + σv √ �t > v with positive probability. ■ lemma a.3 . the investors’ wealth-consumption ratios �i are uniformly bounded and given by �a  = e a t �+ ∞ � τ= t e −ρ �d τ d t �1 −γa × � s  s  �1 −γa � 1 − l a

lemma a.3. substituting foc  into the bud- get constraint  and using the complementary slack- ness condition ℓ i,t+�t w ∗ i,t+�t = 0 , we obtain w ∗ a t = e a t � e −ρ�t �c ∗ a ,t+�t c ∗ a t �−γa w ∗

> 0 . using the bounds on s t , we obtain the following uniform bound on �a : �a  ≤ const × e a t �+ ∞ � τ= t e −ρ �d τ d t �1 −γa �t � .   the series on the right-hand side of the latter inequality is convergent due to condition  on model parameters. eq.  is obtained along the same lines. ■ proof of proposition 2. 1) first, we derive the spd ξa t under the correct be- liefs of investor a . when investor a ’s constraint does not bind, substituting c ∗ a t = s  d t into the ﬁrst order condi- tion  , we ﬁnd that ξa ,t+�t ξa t = e −ρ�t � s  s  �−γa �d t+�t d t �−γa .   eq.  is consistent with spd  because when the constraint does not bind, v t+�t = v t + μv �t + σv �w t + j v � j t < v , and hence the exponential term in  van- ishes. when the constraint of investor a binds, the constraint of investor b is loose: the constraints cannot bind simul- taneously because the stock market would not clear oth- erwise. therefore, the ratio ξb ,t+�t /ξb t is given by foc  for investor b with ℓ b = 0 . using change of measure eq.  , we rewrite the latter spd under the correct be- liefs of investor a : ξa ,t+�t ξa t = e −ρ�t � 1 − s  1 − s  �−γb �d t+�t d t �−γb πb  πa  .   next, from eq.  for consumption share s we ﬁnd that  −γb = e −v t s −γa t . substituting the latter equality into eq.  , and also using eq.  for the increment v t+�t − v t , we obtain ξa ,t+�t ξa t = e −ρ�t � s  s  �−γa �d t+�t d t �−γa × e v t −v t+�t πb  πa  �d t+�t d t �γa −γb = e −ρ�t � s  s  �−γa �d t+�t d t �−γa × exp { v t − v t+�t + μv �t + σv �w t + j v � j t } .   the fact that the constraint of investor a is binding means that v t+�t = v and v t + μv �t + σv �w t + j v ≥ v (because otherwise v t+�t < v , and hence the constraint does not bind). therefore, the exponential term in eq.  can be replaced with exp ( max { 0 , v t + μv �t + σv �w t + j v � j t − v } ) . the latter term vanishes when the constraint of in- vestor a does not bind, and we obtain eq.  . there- fore, both eq.  and eq.  are summarized by eq.  for ξa ,t+�t / ξa t . 2) from the market clearing condition, s t = w a t + w b t . dividing by d t and then rewriting in terms of wealth- consumption ratios, we obtain that � = �a  s  + �b  ) . hence, � is uniformly bounded because �i  are uniformly bounded by lemma a.3. the fact that stock price s t is given by eq.  can be veriﬁed by substituting s t in eq.  into the recursive eq.  . 3) in the unconstrained economy, the state variable v unc t follows dynamics: v unc t = μv �t + σv �w t + j v � j t .   let u t+�t = u t + �u t and v t+�t = v t + �v t , where the in- crements are given by �u t = max { 0 ;v t + μv �t + σv �w t + j v � j t − v } ,   �v t = max { 0 ;v − v t − μv �t − σv �w t − j v � j t } .   the process for the state variable in the constrained econ- omy can be rewritten as v t+�t = v t + μv �t + σv �w t + j v � j t + �v t − �u t .  if the state variables have the same value at time 0, i.e., v 0 = v unc 0 , we obtain v t = v unc t + v t − u t .   next, we prove that the spd is higher in the constrained economy. ξa ,t+�t ξa t = e −ρ�t � s  s  d t+�t d t �−γa exp  ,   ξ unc a ,t+�t ξ unc a t = e −ρ�t � s (v unc t+�t ) s (v unc t ) d t+�t d t �−γa .   iterating the above equations, we obtain ξa t ξa 0 = e −ρt � s  s  d t d 0 �−γa exp  ,   ξ unc a t ξ unc a 0 = e −ρt � s (v unc t ) s  d t d 0 �−γa .   by the deﬁnition of s  in eq.  , we have e v = (1 − s ) γb · s  −γa . hence, ξa t /ξa 0 ξ unc a t /ξ unc a 0 = � s  s (v unc t ) �−γa exp  = � s (v unc t + v t − u t ) s (v unc t ) �−γa e v unc t e −(v unc t −u t ) ≥ s (v unc t − u t ) −γa e −(v

0 ≥ ξ unc a t /ξ unc a 0 . the latter inequality and the asset prices  – imply that prices are higher in the constrained economy. ■ proof of lemma 2. the p/d ratio � and wealth-output ra- tio � �it ≡ w it /d t are functions of the state variable v and satisfy equations: � = e a t �ξa ,t+�t ξa t d t+�t d t � � + �t �� ,   � �i  = e a t �ξa ,t+�t ξa t d t+�t d t � �i  � + � 1 { i = a } s  + 1 { i =

function in discrete time: � � = e a t � e −ρ�t+�u t �d t+�t d t �1 −γa � �  � + s  θ�t,   where �u t is given by eq.  . comparing eq.  with eqs.  and  for � and � �i , and using the linearity of eq.  , it is easy to observe that � and � �i  are given by the following equations in terms of � � : � = � � s  γa − �t,   � �i  =  � �  +  � � ) s  γa .   taking limit �t → 0, and noting that �i  = � �i  /  + 1 { i = b } )) , we obtain eqs.  and  for � and �i . first, we derive the equation for � � when v t be- longs to the interior  . for a suﬃciently small �t , we have �u t = 0 , where �u t is given by  . then, we rewrite the expectation of  1 −γa � � as follows: e a t ��d t+�t d t �1 −γa � �  � =  e a t ��d t+�t d t �1 −γa � �  ����normal � + λa �te a t ��d t+�t d t �1 −γa � �  ����crisis � .   noting that in the crisis d t+�t /d t = 1 + μv �t + j d and v t+�t = max { v ;v t + μv �t + j v } , and in the normal state d t+�t /d t = 1 + μd �t + σd �w t and v t+�t = v t + μv �t + σv �w t , using taylor expansions for  1 −γa and � � , we ﬁnd e a t ��d t+�t d t �1 −γa � � | crisis � =  1 −γa � � � max { v ;v t + j v };θ � .   e a t ��d t+�t d t �1 −γa � � | normal � = � 1 + �  −  γa σ 2 d 2 �

λa  1 −γa � � �t + s  θ �t + o .   canceling similar terms, diving by �t , taking limit �t → 0, and noting that μv , σv and j v converge to � μv , � σv , and � j v given by  – , we obtain eq.  for � � . next, we derive the boundary conditions for � � . from eq.  , the state variable dynamics at lower bound is v t+�t = v + max { 0 , μv �t + σv �w t + j v � j t } . let �v t = v t+�t − v t . then, �v t = max { 0 , μv �t + σv �w t + j v � j t } .   for suﬃciently small �t , the increment �v t is positive only in a state in which σv �w t > 0. in such a state, �v t = μv �t + | σv | √ �t . therefore, the order of e a t  is √ �t , but second order terms involving �v t have lower order: lim �t→ 0 e a t  √ �t = | � σv | 2 , lim �t→ 0 e a t �  2 � √ �t = lim �t→ 0 e a t  √ �t = lim �t→ 0 e a t  √ �t = lim �t→ 0 e a t  √ �t = 0 .   the taylor expansion of � � at v t = v is given by � � = � � + � �′ �v t + 1 2 � �′′ �v 2 t + o( √ �t ) .   in subsequent calculations, we keep terms with order of √ �t . using the above results, we obtain the following ex- pansion: e a t ��d t+�t d t �1 −γa � �  � = e a t �  1 −γa � � � + � �′ �v t + 1 2 � �′′ �v 2 t �� = � � + � �′  e a t  + o( √ �t ) .   substituting  into  , taking into account that �u t = 0 at v t = v , and canceling � � on both sides, we obtain the ﬁrst boundary condition � �′  = 0 . g. chabakauri and b.y. han / journal of financial economics 138  754–776 773 at the upper bound v t = v investor a is constrained, and hence �u t in  is positive. from  the state vari- able at the upper bound is v t+�t = min { v , v t + μv

, we arrive at � � = � � + �� � − � �′  � e a t  + o( √ �t ) .   canceling similar terms, taking limit �t → 0, we obtain condition � � − � �′  = 0 . finally, we derive the equations for v and v . substitut- ing �i  from eq.  into the equations �a  = 0 and �b  = 0 , after some algebra, we obtain eq.  . ■ proof of corollary 1. for λa = λb and γa = γb = γ the differ- ential difference eq.  becomes an ode because � j v = 0 . from eq.  for consumption share s we ﬁnd that s  = 1 /  . substituting s  into  and setting θ = −γ we obtain an equation for � � . it can be directly veriﬁed that the solution of eq.  satisfying boundary conditions  is given by � � = c −e ϕ −v + c + e ϕ + v + � �unc  , where � �unc  = γ � k =0 �γ k � e k v /γ h  ,   and the coeﬃcients are given by c + =  e ϕ −v

r t is given by r t = 1 −e a t  e a t �t = � 1  e a t  + λa �te a t  −1 � 1 �t ,   where ξa ,t+�t /ξa t is given by eq.  . we separately cal- culate e a t  and e a t  , and then take the limit �t → 0. we start with the derivation of e a t  when v < v t < v , and hence by continuity, for a suﬃciently small �t the economy is unconstrained next period, so that v < v t+�t < v . in the unconstrained region, we have �v t = μv �t + σv �w t and the spd is given by  . from the expression for the spd, using expansions  and  from lemma a.4 below, we obtain e a t �ξa ,t+�t ξa t ����normal � = e a t  2 )

where �u t is given by eq.  . using eq.  for the process v t and eq.  for �u t , for a ﬁxed v t and suﬃ- ciently small �t , we ﬁnd that �v t and �u t at the bound- aries are given by �v t = � min  , if v t = v , max  , if v t = v ,   �u t = � 0 , if v t < v , max  , if v t = v ,   we note that for a suﬃciently small �t , the sign of μv �t + σv �w t is solely determined by the second term σv �w t be- cause it has the order of magnitude √ �t . using the lat- ter observation, substituting eqs.  and  into eq.  and computing the expectation, we obtain e a t �ξa ,t+�t ξa t ����normal � = 774 g.
